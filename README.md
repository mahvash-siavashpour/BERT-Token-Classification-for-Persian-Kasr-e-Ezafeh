# BERT Token Tagger for Persian Kasr-e Ezafeh
Each persion word in a sentance either has a Kasr-e Eafeh or it does not. Kas-e Ezafeh comes in 3 different forms as shown bellow:
- @e
- e 
- ve 
- y 
- ye

Using a BERT token classification model from pretrained ```HooshvareLab/distilbert-fa-zwnj-base``` enables us to train the model on this specific task. The dataset could not be published due to copyright but this is a sample of what it looks like:
```
سلسله	ye
ایرانی	O
در	O
سوادکوه	e
مازندران	O
حکومت	O
می‌کردند	O
.	O
نفوذ	e
برامکه	O
)	O
وزرای	ye
ایرانی	O
(	O
در	O
دربار	e
عباسی	O
```

Each token of the data has a label indicating its Kasr-e Ezafeh. Tokens without a tag are labeled as O .
## Training
The model is trained using the [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/) library with a pretrained bert model from [HooshvareLab/distilbert-fa-zwnj-base](https://huggingface.co/HooshvareLab/distilbert-fa-zwnj-base) . <br>
After preprocessing the data and tokenizing, it is fed into the model. The model is trained in 3 epochs with a batch size of 16.
## Results
The results during the training phase after each epoch are shown bellow:
|Epoch  |F1           |Accuracy		|
|-------|-------------|-------------|
|1		|0.930487     |0.985994     |
|2      |0.939853     |0.987362     |
|3      |0.940642	  |0.987561     |
